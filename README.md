# Weather App on Console

This is a small application that runs on command prompt. This application takes in city names as arguments from  the command prompt and outputs the temperature that we find in the city.

### Topics we cover in the Application :-  
- Third Party Weather API  
- Handling API request and response   
- NPM introduction
- Third Party Library 'Yargs'  
- Argument reading from the Prompt  

### NPM   
npm is a NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.  

### Initilizing the Project  
Pull this code on your system or just download the code.   
Then to make this project run, you need to initialize the node modules.  
This is done by going to the directory location on command prompt and running the code there.
  ` npm init `  
**node_modules** folder will be created in folder.  
For starting a new project also you need to use the command npm init. This will create a package.json file for you.  

### API  
We use the Open Weather Map API for getting the weather data.  
You can get the APIs from https://openweathermap.org/api  
Subscribed to its 'Current weather data' API and got a key from it.

### Third Party Library  
Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.  
Read more about it from https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs  
Install it from npm in you directory.  
   ` npm i yargs --save `
    

Rest of the code is easy to go through. Thus far you might have got quiet a bit of understanding of how Node JS works.  
Lets make it more interesting by making this weather app as a web application.  

Hope so you learned something new here.  
Thank you!
